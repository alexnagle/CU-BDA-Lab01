# Data Analysis Interests

**ORIE MEng Project:**
One of the requirements in the ORIE MEng program is a capstone project, in which we work in small teams alongside a company to solve a "real world" problem. 
The project that I am involved with concerns a regional recycling center that processes all of the $0.05 container returns for seven counties. 
A large number (roughly 100 million) of these returns do not come from the reverse vending machines found in most major stores, and a sample of these containers are counted by hand to assign a share to several local beverage distributors. 
Our task is to analyze the sampling methods used, and to suggest and/or implement better methods that are either more accurate or less labor intensive. 
We have found so far that there is significant time-based correlation, but since the relative shares assigned to each distributor move slowly over time, there may be room for bayesian methods in analyzing the prior distributions.

**Misc Interests:**
I am interested in fisheries management, although I am not currently active in any research projects. 
Having lived in rural Alaska for a time, I am deeply committed to sustainable fisheries commercially, recreationally, and for subsistance.
