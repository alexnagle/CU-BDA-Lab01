# Data Analysis Interests

**ORIE MEng Project:**
One of the requirements in the ORIE MEng program is a capstone project, in which we work in small teams alongside a company to solve a "real world" problem. 
The project that I am involved with concerns a regional recycling center that processes all of the $0.05 container returns for seven counties. 
A large number (roughly 100 million) of these returns do not come from the reverse vending machines found in most major stores, and a sample of these containers are counted by hand to assign a share to several local beverage distributors. 
Our task is to analyze the sampling methods used, and to suggest and/or implement better methods that are either more accurate or less labor intensive. 
We have found so far that there is significant time-based correlation, but since the relative shares assigned to each distributor move slowly over time, there may be room for bayesian methods in analyzing the prior distributions.

The following plot shows some historical data for three of the 75 vendors that we are studying. 
The names of the vendors have been redacted.
